DOCUMENT (passage text):
When you are dividing like terms with exponents, use the Quotient of Powers Rule to simplify the problem. This rule states that when you are dividing terms that have the same base, just subtract their exponents to find your answer. The key is to only subtract those exponents whose bases are the same.

DOCUMENT (passage text):
Exponents, Quotients and Subtraction. When dividing two numbers including the same base and different exponents, subtraction comes into play because you subtract the exponent in the dividend by the exponent in the divisor to obtain the result. For example, 10^{13} ÷ 10^{-5} = 10 ^{13-(-5)} = 10^{18}.

what does quotient of a power mean

DOCUMENT (passage text):
Well, you know that if there are more threes in the numerator, you can simplify the fraction by crossing out the number of threes that are in the denominator. How can you figure out how many threes that would leave in the numerator? Subtract the number of threes in the denominator from the number of threes in the numerator. So that’s the rule for dividing exponents – To divide exponents with the same base, just subtract the powers.
